# Herbert-2015

## This is the final repository for Recycle Rush.

##Notes:

Assuming using two XBOX controllers. 
Port 0 = driver
Port 1 = control arm

***** Search for //FIXME or //TODO to see what needs to be done

//Do NOT mess with .gitignore . That caused tons of problems for us earlier.

//get a timer to work

//get a rumble to work

//accelerometer not implemented yet. See Parker's branch in Herbert-IT

//Make sure that all double values are coded as 0.0 not 0

//AUTONOMOUS MODE DO NOT USE -- UNTIL IT HANDLES REVERSE SPEED IN RAMP UP SECTION (for right talon)
//NOTE: there is no limit switch coded in the arm movement so DO NOT USE IT!!!
